# user_access_logs_project
In your consulting firm, there is an annual audit to ensure all access is tracked accordingly for the sales systems. You and your team are a compliance analysts reviewing the current list of employees and their access levels listed on the compliance list provided by your manager.

It is up to you and your team to review the compliance list, compare it to the current active employees list (also provided) and provide a report of the incorrect entries to be updated. Access level is granted to each employee based on their role. In your report of incorrect entries, provide a listing of what their access should be if it is not currently on the compliance list.
